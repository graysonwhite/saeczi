Description: Simplifies the process of fitting a zero-inflated estimator
    onto a dataset. This estimator is a combination of a linear mixed effects regression model 
    and a logistic mixed effects regression model which is summarized by White and others (2024, <arXiv:2402.03263>).
    The variance is estimated through a parametric bootstrapping method which is given 
    by Chandra and others (2012, <doi:10.1080/03610918.2011.598991>).
