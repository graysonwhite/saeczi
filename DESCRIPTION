Description: A package that simplifies the process of fitting a zero-inflated estimator
    onto a dataset. This estimator is a combination of a linear regression model 
    and a logistic regression model which is summarized by Yamamoto et al.
    The variance is estimated through a bootstrapping method which is given 
    by Chandra et al.
